# Students Final Grade Predictions

In this project, I've managed to predict the final grade of some portuguese students.

I considered many features for each of them, ranging from their family background to the time they spend hanging out with friends, passing through the weekly alcohol consumption.

After performing an Exploratory Data Analysis, I used these and many other details to feed different machine learning models, comparing their performances and establishing what's the algorithm that best predicts the students' grades.

The data was taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/javidimail/effect-of-alcohol-use-on-gpa/data).
